/////  Cannon: /////

First create casting molds, x4
------------------------------
clay | wood | clay
clay | wood | clay
clay | clay | clay

The cannon:
-----------
cannon mold | bronze block | cannon mold
cannon mold | bronze block | cannon mold
coal block  | coal block   | coal block

The cannonball 
--------------

(May be turned off in settings, so ask server owner before wasting resources)

empty        | bronze ingot | empty
bronze ingot | bronze ingot | bronze ingot
empty        | bronze ingot | empty

You also need:
--------------
-Gunpowder from the tnt mod (to fire the cannon.)
-A stick (To unload the cannon.)
-A torch (To fire/ignite the cannon.)

How to use:
-----------

The cannon can be (partially) disabled in the mod_settings.lua file. 
Assuming the cannon is fully active, these are the steps. (Chat will tell you if something is disabled.)

-Place the cannon. The cannon requires two blocks, like a bed.
-Take gunpowder into your hand, and punch the cannon with it.
-Take cannonball into your hand and punch the cannon with it.
-To unload the cannon again, punch it with a stick. The cannonball and powder will pop out.
-To fire the cannon, punch it with a regular torch.

The cannon will fire the distance set in mod_settings.lua and the trajectory will drop one block every third of the way.
Once the cannon reaches its max distance (set in mod_settings.lua) it will create a semi-random crater, the size of which
is also set in mod_settings.lua. Please be aware this may be very large! If along the way the cannon has to punch through
n nodes (n is also set in mod_settings.lua) it will stop and crater right there. Cannon gone? You probably tried to shoot
through n nodes too close to your cannon.

Nodes punched through along the way will not drop drops. In your crater about 60% of nodes will be destroyed without drops.

THIS IS NOT A MINING TOOL.

///// Cannon hatches /////

The cannon hatches were based on the trapdoor mod, they function the same way.
If you have trouble placing them, place a dirt block behind where you want them, then
remove after placing.
