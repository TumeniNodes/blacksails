A personal request
------------------

Real life pirates were not nice people. The heyday of piracy was also
the time things like slavery and colonialist expansion were at their
peak. As a favour to me I request you do not use this mod to create
products that may serve to excuse, deny or distort these historical facts.
I particularly would be very upset if this mod was ever expanded with 
overtly racist imagery, 'blackface' imagery (including 'Zwarte Piet') or
questionable imagery such as battle flags, confederate flags, etc.

Make your own mod if you must. But please don't do it here.

A note on imagery
-----------------

The mod author is a historian. This mod includes images for historical
accuracy that may be offensive to some, such as the VOC logo. (A company
that also traded in slaves.) The author has chosen to not downplay this
aspect of the subject matter out of respect for those who were victims
of it. Please note that the author descends from both slave-owners and
slaves. The author's decision to not 'white wash' history should not be
seen as an attempt to trivialize.

Not sure?

Version
-------

0.1 Beta WIP... In other words: this is the very first release and I'm not giving any guarantees.

What the mod does.
------------------
This mod adds building blocks and items to give your game a pirate look & feel.


How to install
--------------
Extract the zip file into your mods folder. Open mod_settings.lua to edit some important settings if you are
running a server. (Some components of this mod can be very destructive.)


What dependencies there are
---------------------------
This mod should work fine with the minitest standard game. Some items may be out of place without
the Dreambuilder mods to provide additional things. (Like cannon hatches in wood types not available
without the appropriate mods.) Nothing should break though.


Where to report problems/bugs or get help
-----------------------------------------

You are free to e-mail nobeard@xs4all.nl or to ask in the forum. But if it breaks, it probably just ... 
breaks at this point.
